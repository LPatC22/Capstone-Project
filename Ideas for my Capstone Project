Ideas for my Capstone Project

Idea 1. I want to predict the number of people that move from the state of Tennessee to the state of Michigan.
This information could help a human resources department when making offers for relocation to people they are 
interested in hiring. 

Idea 2. I want to predict the cover type that appears in a forest based on several physical factors.
Data Set: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/
This information could help a department of agriculture, or activist group (against top mountain removal, for example)
to know what kind of vegetation is present in the very high part of the mountain that cannot be reached by hiking. 

Idea 3. I want to predict the contraceptive method choice(no use, short-term method, long-term method) of a woman based
on her socio-economic characteristics. 
Data Set: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/cmc/
This information would be useful to the administrator of a department of health that wants to make sure the women 
around its clinics have available the contraceptive method of their choice. 


Notes:

Idea 1: I looked up for a dataset with the factors involved in people migrating from one city to another, but 
couldn't find it. I found not one, but several data sets for groups of factor, but not with all factors. They are
heavy datasets (data.gov) and all of them contain metadata. Thus I decided to drop this out.
